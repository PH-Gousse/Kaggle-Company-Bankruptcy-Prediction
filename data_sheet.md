- Creators: The dataset was compiled by Deron Liang and Chih-Fong Tsai from National Central University, Taiwan. It is available on Kaggle, originally sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- Funding: Information on specific funding for the dataset creation is not provided.

 
## Composition

- Instances: The dataset contains financial indicators for companies, focusing on features that can predict bankruptcy.
- Types of Instances: Each instance represents financial data points and indicators for a company.
- Number of Instances: The dataset contains 6,819 instances.
- Missing Data: No information on missing data is provided.
- Confidential Data: The dataset does not contain confidential data protected by legal privilege or doctor–patient confidentiality.

## Collection process

- Acquisition: The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal.
- Sampling Strategy: Specific sampling strategy details are not provided.
- Time Frame: The data was collected for the years 1999 to 2009, with bankruptcy defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling:
  - The data includes preprocessing steps such as feature extraction and possibly normalisation.
  - Specific details on preprocessing steps are not provided.
- Raw Data: Information on the availability of raw data is not mentioned.
 
## Uses

- Other Tasks: The dataset could be used for educational purposes, financial risk analysis, and other predictive modeling tasks related to financial health.
- Impact on Future Uses: Users should be aware of the ethical implications of using financial data to avoid biases that could lead to unfair treatment or incorrect predictions.
- Unsuitable Tasks: The dataset should not be used for making definitive financial decisions without proper validation and expert analysis.
